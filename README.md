## Marble Sorter
This project was also worked on with Pedro Aguilar, used ROBOTC, and VEX Robotics parts. The machine is designed to sort forty wood, glass, opaque white plastic, and metal marbles (10 of each type) in assorted sizes. A push rod and rangefinder work together to push one marble into position to be scanned by flashlight and light sensor. A ramp on a motor. That motor will extend the ramp based on the marble type.
